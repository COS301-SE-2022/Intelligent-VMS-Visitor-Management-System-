The VMS is an intelligent visitor management system that allows provides a platform for building residents to create invites for visitors, contractors or even prospective buyers.

        I am an analytical, energetic and motivated person with a love for Computers and Computer Science. I value those around me, but I do like my 
        alone time. I’ve fallen in the love with the complexities that 
        Computer Science has to offer and excited to learn more about 
        it every day.

    My dream is to create new experiences for the people of the 21st century, wishing to achieve this with the ever-developing technology. Although I 
    believe that one can achieve anything you set your mind to, I would list android development as my greatest technical skill which I have been perfecting since 2017. Other qualities worth mentioning include my immense creativity, thirst for learning and polished communication skills.
